# isomorphic-unzip

This is part of the project [isomorphic-pkg-reader](https://npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-pkg-reader).

Now it's only provide a few simple apis for supporting `isomorphic-pkg-reader`,
it can read the specific entries from a .zip file and parse them to Buffer, it works both for NodeJS and Browsersify/Webpack.

Basically it's just a wrap for `yauzl`(NodeJS) and `zip.js`(browser), and make it has nearly consistence apis.
